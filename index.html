                          <h4 style="color: white;">Unplug Electronics When Not Using</h4>
                          <p style="color: white;">Anytime there is too much electricity running through something in your house, there is a risk of a fire. Even when they are off, electronics like computers, TVs, game consoles, and many more use electricity. That implies that they are always susceptible to surges or simple overheating that results in a fire. </p> 
                          <p style="color: white;">These have a source for a fire due to the constant flow of energy into them. You can reduce your chances of starting a fire by unplugging these appliances while you're not using them and, consequently, not paying attention to them.</p>

                          <p style="color: white;">Make sure to keep an eye on anything that involves a flame or a lot of heat, whether you're cooking, lighting candles, or doing anything else similar. Never leave the stove alone when preparing anything. Make sure to keep an eye on any fires you create in your fireplace as well.</p>
                          <p style="color: white;">By keeping a watch on these kinds of flames, you'll be able to see any issues or abnormalities from the usual right away. This implies that you would be able to address the issue swiftly and ensure the safety of you and your family. </p>

                          <p style="color: white;">Although you shouldn't go into your home's walls to inspect electrical lines, you should check everything that is visible. Keep an eye on your home's wall outlets and pay notice to any that stop functioning suddenly.</p>
                          <p style="color: white;">There might be proof that there is an issue within the walls. Check your electric accessories for frayed or damaged cords. You shouldn't plug these into your electrical system if you already know there is an issue because they could also be warning indications.</p>

                          <h4 style="color: white;">Extinguish the Fire</h4>
                          <p style="color: white;">It's crucial to always be mindful of your actions if you have a fireplace. It's important to make sure the fire is completely out before leaving the area so you can keep an eye on the fireplace and make sure it doesn't start again.</p>
                          <p style="color: white;">Embers can keep smoldering and burning, and logs can keep harboring flames that appear much later. Before you go to bed or leave the house, you should make sure the fire is totally extinguished. After that, you should keep an eye out for any potential future fires.</p>
